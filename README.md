# News By Mood

The goal behind News By Mood was to understand how news articles can elicit specific emotional responses within their readers and give these readers an “emotional profile” of the article beforehand. It also provides users with a "source personality" of each source found on the website, which is meant to be a snapshot of the kinds of tones found in articles written by that source.
